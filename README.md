easygraph
=========

To get the project runnable, perform the following tasks:
--------------------

1) Install the e(fx)clipse Eclipse plugin for JavaFX. Eclipse' version has to be 4.3 or greater.
    (without this plugin, you will not be able to create a JavaFX project with the eclipse wizard)
    
2) Make a new directory somewhere and use this as project workspace
    (example:  C:\workspaces)
    
3) Check out the repository into a subfolder of this workspace
    (example:  C:\workspaces\easygraph)
    
4) In Eclipse, create a new JavaFX project: de-select "use default location", instead use the checked out directory as location.
    (example:  location = C:\workspaces\easygraph, project name = EasyGraph)
